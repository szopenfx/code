Old code and projects. I'm trying to gather as much of it as I can find, if possible in chronological order.
A hellish task, if you ask me.

This is what I've found (and documented here) so far:

    csharp/kisp: kim il-sung's politbyuro, a p2p file share program with built-in chess game

    delphi/lisp: a compiler for a lisp-like language called NUMP

    java/explore3d: a 3d file system browser in java/java3d 

    java/graphics: some graphical scenes in java/java3d

    python/knights: calculates a knight's tour on a chess board

    python/sudoku: a sudoku solver
