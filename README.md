Welcome to my code archive. I'm trying to gather as much 
of old code as I can find, if possible in chronological 
order. A hellish task, if you ask me.

This is what I've found (and documented here) so far:

`csharp/kisp`: Kim Il-Sung's Politbyuro, a P2P file share program with built-in chess game.

`delphi/lisp`: A compiler for a LISP-like language called NUMP.

`java/explore3d`: A 3d file system browser in Java3D. 

`java/graphics`: Some graphical scenes in Java3D. I especially like the colorful MÃ¶bius strip.

`python/knights`: Calculates a knight's tour on a variously-sized chess boards.

`python/sudoku`: A Sudoku solver that supports all kinds of weird variations on Sudoku.
