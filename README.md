# My old code archive

Welcome to my code archive. I'm trying to gather as much 
of old code as I can find, if possible in chronological 
order. A hellish task, if you ask me.

Some code was made with friends. MB, MD, MdJ, MvdV, JD: 
I assume you're all O.K. with your code and other stuffs 
sitting here.

This is what I've found (and documented here) so far. It 
includes games, experiments with graphics, compilers, 
and a lot of brainfuck for some reason. I still have some 
old disks to go...
