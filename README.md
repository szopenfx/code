Welcome to my code archive. I'm trying to gather as much 
of old code as I can find, if possible in chronological 
order. A hellish task, if you ask me.

This is what I've found (and documented here) so far:

# C# #

[kisp][ck]: Kim Il-Sung's Politbyuro, a P2P file share program with built-in chess game.

[lisp][cl]: A compiler for a LISP-like language called NUMP.

# Java #

[checkers][jc]: A checkers game

[explore3d][je]: A 3d file system browser in Java3D. 

[graphics][jg]: Some graphical scenes in Java3D. I especially like the colorful MÃ¶bius strip.

# Python #

[knights][pk]: Calculates a knight's tour on a variously-sized chess boards.

[sudoku][ps]: A Sudoku solver that supports all kinds of weird variations on Sudoku.
